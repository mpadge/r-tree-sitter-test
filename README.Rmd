This package is for testing an issue in [Davis Vaughan's `r-tree-sitter`
package](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/r-tree-sitter). Run the following code
after installing this package (called "test"):

First, download a random tarball into `tempdir()`:

```{r dl}
path <- test::dl_tarball ("odbc_1.5.0.tar.gz")
```

Then run the following code to demonstrate the problem:

```{r demo, error = TRUE}
bodies <- test::get_captures (path)
library (test)
bodies <- test::get_captures (path)
```

Those both error, and yet work when the full namespace of this package is
loaded:

```{r}
pkg_path <- "/<local>/<path>/<to>/r-tree-sitter-test/"
devtools::load_all (pkg_path)
bodies <- test::get_captures (path)
length (bodies)
```
